A lot of the decisions we've made over the years have been directly influenced by the conversations that have gone on in our community chats and we've watched in astonishment as random people on the internet helped other random people through both good times and bad times. We've gotten request after request over the years for us to register as an EOSIO Block Producer, and we're finally ready to step into that role and take on yet another responsibility which helps secure users, and the network.

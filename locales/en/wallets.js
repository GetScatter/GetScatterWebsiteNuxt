        safetytext2: "Since Bridge is a fully custodial service we impose holding and spending limitations during a given time-frame. This makes it so accounts can't be 'cleaned out' by someone who has gotten a hold of your Facebook account for example, and also pushes users to learn about blockchain and move to a safer non-custodial platform like Scatter Desktop.",
        safetytext3: "When logging into each app you also set your own limitations on it to ensure that an application never has more access to your account or it's assets than you are willing to give it.",

        ownership: "Take ownership",
        ownershiptext: "The goal of the Scatter Bridge service isn't to keep users using the service. Instead, it is meant as the middle-ground between first using a blockchain and learning about how to keep your assets safe. We believe the best way to educate users about blockchain is to get them using it first, and give them a reason to educate themselves. We offer clear and easy steps that a user can take to export their accounts from bridge right into Scatter Desktop with a single file once they are ready to take the leap to full ownership of their private keys."

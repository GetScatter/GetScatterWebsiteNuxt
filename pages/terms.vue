                        <p>12.1 The Site and/or Services may contain links to third party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by us (individually, and collectively, the "<strong>Third Party Websites</strong>").</p>

                        <p>12.2 These Third Party Websites may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Websites will be governed by, and subject to, such terms and conditions and privacy policies. You must ensure that you have read, understood and agreed to all of the terms and conditions, policies and guidelines of the Third Party Websites.</p>

                        <p>12.3 You understand and agree that the Company does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, opinions, advice, statements, prices, advertisement, or any other content of any of the Third Party Websites or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Websites.</p>

                        <h3>13. Risk Factors</h3>

                        <p>By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Content or Site in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems, and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, smart contract based tokens that follow various tokens standards, and blockchain-based software systems.</p>

                        <p>You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all other information contained in these Terms of Use before using any of the Services.</p>

                        <p>13.1 An inherent risk exists that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. You may increase or lose value in your assets at any time due to price volatility, especially in the crypto-currency market, and the potential loss in trading or holding Digital Currencies can be substantial.</p>

                        <p>13.2 We do not guarantee that any Digital Currency will currently, or in the future maintain a certain value or market liquidity, and you understand that the current value or price of Digital Currency can drop as low as zero at any point. You acknowledge that we also do not guarantee that you will be able to sell the Digital Currency to any third party.</p>

                        <p>13.3 Historically, currency, and fiat money in particular, have been backed by banks and government entities, or backed up by commodities, such as silver or gold. However, Digital Currency is not regulated by any central bank or other government authority. Instead, Digital Currency is backed by technology and trust, and currently, there is no bank or government regulator that can take measures to protect the value of the Digital Currency in a crisis, issue more currency, or balance the price fluctuations.</p>

                        <p>13.4 Digital Currency is based on blockchain technologies, a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking, which could collapse at any given moment, and cryptography to maintain its integrity. This system has been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Site and the Services could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including, without limitation, the licensing of or restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens which could impede, limit or end the Services or your ability to trade the Digital Currency at any point. Regulatory changes could have negative and material impact that could result in the Digital Currency having little or no value whatsoever.</p>

                        <p>13.5 Digital Currency, when transferred, will be controllable only by the possessor of unique private keys relating to the addresses in which the Digital Currency is held. The theft, loss or destructions of a private key required to access Digital Currency is irreversible, and because the Company does not have access to those private keys, such private keys cannot be restored by the Company, and the Company will not be responsible for user&rsquo;s loss of access to its personal virtual wallet. Further, due to the nature of Digital Currency, any technological difficulties experienced by the Company could potentially prevent the access or use of a user&rsquo;s Digital Currency.</p>

                        <p>13.6 You are aware that additional risks of trading Digital Currency may exist that have not been set forth in these Terms of Use, and you understand that it is your responsibility to carefully assess all the risks and determine whether your financial standing and tolerance for risk are suitable for buying, selling or trading Digital Currency. It is also your responsibility to seek professional advice prior to using the Services and the Site, and you understand that the Company does not provide any investment, legal, or tax advice.</p>

                        <p>13.7 Certain regulators in certain jurisdictions may view certain types of Digital Currency as securities, and as such, users in these jurisdictions may not have the ability to trade their Digital Currency because trading of Digital Currency that is deemed as securities, may be restricted, partially or completely in some jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to ensure your compliance with the applicable laws of your jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>13.8 The Company and its supported blockchains and tokens could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the Company to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services or any supported blockchains and their networks.</p>

                        <p>13.9 You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Services, which could result in the theft or loss of your digital assets such as your keypairs, cryptographic tokens or property. To the extent possible, the Company intends to update the protocols underlying the Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By using the Services, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks.</p>

                        <p>13.10 You acknowledge that blockchain applications are code and subject to flaws, and you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Services, and the trustworthiness of any Third Party Websites, products, smart-contracts, or Content you access or use through the Services. Any loss of digital property and/or identity theft, including the Company's risk factors set out herein, in no way evidence or represent any ongoing duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services, Site or Content.</p>

                        <p>13.11 The Company cannot and does not guarantee the availability of the Services at all times. You acknowledge that the Company reserves the right, at all times, to delay, deny, or make unavailable, at any time and at its sole discretion, any or all of the Services, any part of the Site and/or the Site in its entirety. The Company shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in connection with the unavailability of any Service and/or the Site, whether caused by the Company by any third party or &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo;. For the purpose of these Terms, &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; means an event beyond the reasonable control of the Company, including without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, fire, flood or storm damage, earthquakes, labor disputes, war, and riot. You acknowledge that once a day, for a limited time, the Services will not be available for use due to the need to perform processing and other operations necessary for the ongoing functionality of the Services.</p>
